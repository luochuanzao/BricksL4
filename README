L4Ka::Pistachio is the latest L4 microkernel developed by the System
Architecture Group at the University of Karlsruhe in collaboration
with the DiSy group at the University of New South Wales,
Australia. It is the first available kernel implementation of the L4
Version 4 kernel API (currently code-named Version X.2), which is
fully 32 and 64 bit clean, provides multiprocessor support, and
super-fast local IPC.

This is a L4 based project for x86 and ARM architecture
